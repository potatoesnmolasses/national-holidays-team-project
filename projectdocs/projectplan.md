# Project Plan:
1. Define Requirements:
   * Determine the scope of the API (e.g., which countries' holidays to support, which holidays to include, etc.).
   * Decide on the endpoints and data format (JSON, XML, etc.).
2. Design API:
   * Design the API endpoints including CRUD operations for managing holidays.
   * Define request and response formats.
   * Determine error handling strategies.
3. Set Up Development Environment
4. Implement Data Model:
   * Define the data model for representing holidays (e.g., Holiday class with attributes like name, date, country, etc.).
   * Set up a database
5. Develop RESTful Web Service:
   * Implement CRUD operations for managing holidays using Java's JAX-RS.
   * Handle HTTP requests and responses according to the defined API design.
   * Implement error handling for various scenarios (e.g., invalid requests, server errors).
6. Test:
   * Write unit tests for each endpoint to ensure they work as expected.
   * Perform integration tests to validate the entire API functionality.
   * Test for edge cases and boundary conditions.
7. Document API:
   * Generate API documentation using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI.
   * Document endpoints, request/response formats, and usage examples.
8. Security:
   * Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms if required.
   * Ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
9. Deployment:
   * Choose a deployment platform
   * Configure the server environment.
   * Deploy the RESTful web service.
10. Monitoring and Maintenance:
    * Set up logging and monitoring tools to track API usage and performance.
    * Establish procedures for handling maintenance tasks and updates.

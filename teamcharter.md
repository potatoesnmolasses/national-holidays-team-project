# Team Charter

## Problem Statement
In the United States there are 11 designated federal holidays, as well as a sizable number of days with cultural, religious, or historical significance that are celebrated annually.  But what about those days that are less well-known and often underappreciated?  What about National Dress Up Your Pet Day (January 14), or Lucky Penny Day (May 23)?  How are we to remember to have cheese fondue on the one day of the year *dedicated* to cheese fondue, April 11?

This API is intended to tackle that exact issue.  It can be used to view, update, and delete existing holidays, and to create new ones.  Whether you want to keep track of the upcoming days in general or make sure you're never caught out with facial hair on National No Beard Day (October 18), the Holiday Wizard can help!
